Great question! Both `gcc` and `g++` are part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), but they serve slightly different purposes:

### `gcc`
- **Primary Use**: Compiling C programs.
- **C++ Support**: Can compile C++ programs, but treats them as C programs unless specified otherwise.
- **Command**: When you use `gcc` to compile a C++ program, you need to explicitly specify the C++ standard library using the `-lstdc++` flag.
- **File Extensions**: Typically used for `.c` files, but can also compile `.cpp` files with the appropriate flags.

### `g++`
- **Primary Use**: Compiling C++ programs.
- **C++ Support**: Automatically links the C++ standard library and treats files as C++ by default.
- **Command**: Simplifies the process of compiling C++ programs by automatically handling the linking of the C++ standard library.
- **File Extensions**: Typically used for `.cpp` files.

### Key Differences
- **Default Behavior**: `gcc` defaults to C, while `g++` defaults to C++.
- **Library Linking**: `g++` automatically links the C++ standard library, whereas `gcc` requires explicit linking for C++ programs.
- **Syntax Handling**: `g++` handles C++ syntax and features more naturally, while `gcc` requires additional flags and considerations.

### Example
To compile a C++ program named `example.cpp`:
- Using `gcc`:
  ```sh
  gcc example.cpp -lstdc++ -o example
  ```
- Using `g++`:
  ```sh
  g++ example.cpp -o example
  ```

In summary, while both can compile C++ programs, `g++` is specifically designed for C++ and handles it more seamlessly. `gcc` is more general-purpose and requires additional steps for C++.

Is there anything specific you'd like to know more about regarding `gcc` or `g++`?
